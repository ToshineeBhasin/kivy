events. The applications made using Kivy will similar across all the platforms but it also means that the applications fell or
look will differ from any native application.

Creating a kivy application is as simple as:

2) implementing its build() method so it returns a Widget instance (the root of your widget tree)
3) instantiating this class, and calling its run() method.
